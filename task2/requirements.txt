• Given a positive integer n, write a program to find out a nonzero multiple m of n whose decimal representation contains
only the digits 0 and 1. You may assume that n is not greater than 200 and there is a corresponding m containing no more than 100 decimal digits.
• Input
• The input file may contain multiple test cases. Each line contains a value of
n (1 <= n <= 200). A line containing a zero terminates the input.
• Output
• For each value of n in the input print a line containing the corresponding value of m. The decimal representation of
m must not contain more than 100 digits. If there are multiple solutions for a given value of n, any one of them is acceptable.

For example,
Input 2，output 10;
Input 6，output 1110;
Input 9，output 111111111;
